University project related to the management of concurrency between processes - SO Course Project - Version 1.9.4

Creation of a game in which players (managed by the CPU), compete with each other for the conquest
of some flags placed within a playing field modeled as a chessboard. To conquer a flag, the players must
move their pawns above it.
There are 3 types of process:
1. A master process that runs the game,
2. A fixed number of player processes,
3. A fixed number of pawn processes for each player.
